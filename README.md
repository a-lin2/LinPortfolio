### About Me
![Profile Image](images/profile_pic.jpeg)
Hello! I am a psychology student and an aspiring child counselor with a year of proven childcare and ESL Tutoring expertise.  

With skills in communication, teaching, and creative problem solving, I can work with children in various settings and help them achieve their academic goals. I am adept at using positive reinforcement, Total Physical Response (TPR), and Communicative Language Teaching (CLT). 

My specific skill set, commitment to child and family care, and passion for advocating for children’s mental health make me a valuable asset. I enjoy photography, cooking, and doing yoga in my free time.

### Projects

#### Personal Budget Tracker
*The personal budget tracker project serves to track all my finances, including current savings, monthly income, expenses, debts, and savings goals.*

##### Initial project idea 

* My goal for this project was to compartmentalize my expenses into their own sections, so I could become more aware of what I'm spending money on. I set out to solve the problem of not knowing where my money was going each month. This needed to be solved because being financially aware and responsible is crucial for planning for the future and achieving financial independence. 

##### Tools I used:  

* I learned to navigate Excel and use basic formulas, like "=SUM", to calculate the total income and expenses. 

##### Challenges I faced:  

* The main challenge with this project was figuring out the layout and how to label and organize things in a way that is clear and easy to follow. However, that challenge was easy to overcome once I put all the information down, and I played with the borders and shading to make everything more organized and readable. 

##### Other Resources:  

* Some resources that helped me with this project were sample budget trackers. I used them as a guide for what information to include. 

##### Result:  

* I did achieve the objective of the project, which was to create a clean budget tracker that will help easily trace my monthly expenses and set saving goals for myself. If I had the chance to take this project further, I would look into developing a long-term plan for repaying loans, including information like how much is owed, the interest rates, and how long it would take to repay them. This project also helped me think about my financial future, preparing for expenses like rent, mortgage payments, car insurance, and family needs. It emphasized the importance of starting to budget and save now to successfully manage larger financial responsibilities later on.

#### Couse Grade Evaluation
*The Course Grade Evaluation is a Python-based project, requiring us to build a program that prints out a student’s average quiz, assessment, and overall course grade.*

##### Initial project idea:  

* The code provides a more convenient way for users to calculate all the grades for a class while also displaying the breakdown. The goal was to create a tool that simplifies grade calculation and helps users understand their course performance. 

##### Tools I used:  

* For this project, I used JDoodle to write and run Python code. I learned how to calculate averages, perform error checking, type cast, and display a letter grade along with the group average. 

##### Challenges I faced:  

* The project was a bit of a challenge because I was still getting used to programming with Python. Error checking was especially difficult since I had just learned about it and wasn't sure how to implement it independently. I overcame this challenge by modeling my code off the example provided in class. 

##### Other Resources:  

* The resources that helped me included the class example and revisiting the class recording to review areas where I struggled. 

##### Result: 

* I ran the code multiple times with various inputs, and everything worked perfectly. If I took the project further, I would add error checking for the inputs of quizzes and assessments to prevent any mistakes. Overall, the project assessed a variety of Python skills and helped me become more detail-oriented and thoughtful about preventing user input errors.

#### Bi-Weekly Timesheet
*This project is a bi-weekly Excel timesheet created to accurately track work hours, breaks, and totals, improving organization, time management, and payment calculation for employees and employers.*

##### Initial project idea:  

* This project is a bi-weekly Excel timesheet designed to track clock-in and clock-out times, break periods, and total hours worked, ensuring precise record-keeping and simplified work hour calculation for both employees and employers. The goal of this project was to improve organization and time management in the workplace by assisting employees and employers with accurate hours and payment calculation. 

##### Tools I used:  

* The project was created in Excel. I used various formulas to calculate total hours worked, excluding break times. I also learned about formatting for dates, days of the week, hours, and time (e.g., hh:mm AM/PM format). 

##### Challenges I faced:  

* The only challenge in this project was making sure that the data was entered in the correct format, like the hh:mm AM/PM format. Once I entered all my test data and the formulas, I double-checked to see if everything was adding up correctly. 

##### Other Resources:  

* The only resource I used was the sample timesheet that was provided as an example. 

##### Result:  

* The results turned out just as I wanted. Everything was organized and easy to read. If I had the chance to take the project further, I would include the pay rate and create a calculation to determine the amount owed to the employee based on their timesheet.
